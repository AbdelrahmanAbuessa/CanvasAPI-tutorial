# This was done as a way to mess around the HTML Canvas Element, Check the JavaScript file to see the code :D
## Context: I did this to learn how to use the Canvas element to animate objects and motion, then to be used and improved in the Physics Simulator that i built,
messing around the commands and trying different methods to move stuff, if you still want to try it then here's a live demo:

Notes: using the browser's console, you can edit values and modify the animation
